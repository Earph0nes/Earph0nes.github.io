    <p>Chuzzo was started on July 26th, 2024.
        I wanted to make a game in a short amount of time for fun.
        The game was code complete and functional by July 31st, 2024. I started showing builds to friends and immediately encountered an issue: 
        the player could find "god spots" and score the max points without moving. 
        To counter this I added the moving platforms seen in the final build. God spots still exist, but timing became a factor.
        A personal goal I had this year was to ship my own game on Steam, so as testing was occurring I started the process of setting up a Steamworks account. 
        This process took longer than the game, but a lot of knowledge was obtained. I have two regrets with this title. I rushed a lot of the Steam artwork and didn't realize the design flaw of the 1000 pucks dropped achievement.
        Players were finishing all the other achievements way faster, so it was just grinding to get the final 1000 pucks dropped. In hindsight, 300 would have been more appropriate.
